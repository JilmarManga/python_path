*** Operator Overloading in Python ***

-- 1. What is Operator Overloading?
By default, operators like + and == only work with predefined data types (numbers, strings, lists, etc.). However, with operator overloading, we can modify how these operators behave with our custom classes.

Example: Overloading + Operator

Imagine a Vector class where we want to sum two vectors using +. We achieve this using the magic method __add__:

'''

class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    # Overload the + operator
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Vector({self.x}, {self.y})'

v1 = Vector(2, 3)
v2 = Vector(4, 1)

v3 = v1 + v2 # overloaded + operator
print(v3)  # Output: Vector(6, 4)

'''
Here, __add__ defines how two Vector objects should be summed, creating a new vector with the sum of their components.
'''

print('\n\n\ ---------------------------------')

'''
-- 2. Overloading Comparison Operators (==, <, >)
Overloading is not limited to arithmetic operators; we can also redefine comparison operators to compare objects based on custom attributes.

Example: Overloading == for Object Comparison
'''

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Overload the == operator
    def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
        return self.name == other.name and self.age == other.age

p1 = Person('John', 28)
p2 = Person('Jane', 25)
p3 = Person('John', 28)

print(p1 == p2) # Output = False
print(p1 == p3) # Output = True

'''
Here, __eq__ allows the == operator to compare two Person objects based on their name and age attributes.
'''

print('\n\n\ ---------------------------------')


'''
-- 3. Overloading Other Operators (<, -, *)

Example: Overloading < (Less Than Operator)
'''

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Overload the < operator
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.age < other.age

p1 = Person('John', 28)
p2 = Person('Jane', 25)

print(p1 < p2) # Output = False

'''
Here, __lt__ allows the < operator to compare two Person objects based on age.
'''


'''
-- 4. Best Practices for Operator Overloading:

	â€¢ Use overloading when it makes sense: Donâ€™t overload operators unnecessarily. Use it only when it makes intuitive sense.

	â€¢ Maintain consistency: If you overload +, ensure it behaves as expected (e.g., summing components in a Vector class).

	â€¢ Document behavior: Overloaded operators can make code cleaner, but itâ€™s important to document how they behave, especially if their functionality isnâ€™t obvious.
'''


'''
-- 5. Practical Exercise: Overloading + in a Fraction Class:

- Objective: Implement a Fraction class that allows adding fractions using +.
- Requirements:
	â€¢	The class should have numerator and denominator.
	â€¢	The + operator should return the result in simplified form.
'''

from math import gcd

class Fraction:
    def __init__(self, numerator, denominator):
        self.numerator = numerator
        self.denominator = denominator

    def __add__(self, other_fraction):
        new_num = self.numerator * other_fraction.denominator + other_fraction.numerator * self.denominator
        new_den = self.denominator * other_fraction.denominator
        common_divisor = gcd(new_num, new_den)
        return Fraction(new_num // common_divisor, new_den // common_divisor)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.numerator}/{self.denominator}"

f1 = Fraction(1, 4)
f2 = Fraction(1, 2)

f3 = f1 + f2  # Fraction addition
print(f3)  # Output: 3/4

'''
This example shows how to redefine + to intuitively add fractions.
