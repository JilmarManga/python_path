Here’s a Battle War game implementation in Python using the random library. The game involves a player and the system taking turns to “attack” each other until one of them runs out of health. I’ve structured the code using clean, senior-level practices with clear comments.


Key Features:

	1	Object-Oriented Design:
	•	The Character class encapsulates properties (name, health, attack_power) and methods (attack, is_alive).
	•	The game logic uses instances of the Character class for both the player and the system.

    2	Randomized Attacks:
	•	The random.randint() function generates a random damage value within the specified range for each attack.

    3	Dynamic Health Display:
	•	After each turn, the current health of both the player and the system is displayed.

    4	Game Loop:
	•	The game continues until one character’s health reaches 0.



Example Output:

Welcome to Battle War! 💥
You and the system will take turns attacking until one of you loses all health.

Your Turn! ⚔️
You dealt 18 damage to the System!

Player's Health: 100
System's Health: 82

System's Turn! 💻
The System dealt 14 damage to you!

Player's Health: 86
System's Health: 82

...

Congratulations! You defeated the System! 🎉
Game Over. Thanks for playing!



This code is scalable, follows Python’s clean coding standards, and ensures a fun and fair battle experience! 😊
