In data analysis, it is essential to understand and use various statistical measures to correctly interpret information. These measures help summarize and describe the main characteristics of a dataset, enabling informed decision-making. Some of the most common statistical measures and their associated formulas are as follows:
	1.	Mean (Average)
The arithmetic mean is calculated by adding all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values.

Formula:

\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}

Where:
	•	 n  is the total number of values.
	•	 x_i  represents each individual value in the dataset.

	2.	Median
The median is the value that separates the upper half from the lower half of an ordered dataset.

	•	If  n  (the number of observations) is odd, the median is the value at position  \frac{n+1}{2}  after ordering the data.
	•	If  n  is even, the median is the average of the two central values:

\text{Median} = \frac{x_{\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\frac{n}{2}+1}}{2}


	3.	Mode
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. There is no specific formula for mode; it is determined by counting the frequency of each value and selecting the one with the highest frequency.
	4.	Standard Deviation
The standard deviation measures the dispersion of data relative to the mean. It is calculated as the square root of the variance.

Formula:

\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}

Where:
	•	 \mu  is the mean of the data.
	•	 x_i  represents each individual value.
	•	 n  is the total number of values.

	5.	Variance
The variance is the average of the squared differences between each value and the dataset’s mean.

Formula:

\text{Variance} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2}{n}

	6.	Maximum and Minimum

	•	Maximum ( \max(x) ): The highest value in a dataset.
	•	Minimum ( \min(x) ): The lowest value in a dataset.

	7.	Range
The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

Formula:

\text{Range} = \max(x) - \min(x)


These mathematical formulas allow for basic statistical analysis of any dataset, such as monthly sales in a business, and are fundamental for drawing conclusions and making data-driven decisions.

By applying these measures, you can extract valuable insights and make informed decisions, which is crucial for success in various fields, from scientific research to business management.
